Purpose:

This application allows users to structure their day to day activities around Simon Sinek's "Start With Why" philosophy (https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en).
Similar to how companies are structured around a vision/mission statement that drives all downstream business decisions, users are able to create 
their own "Why" statements and break down that why into "Hows", then "Whats", and finally tasks that can be inserted into the user's 
Google Calendar. It also gives users the ability to establish goals at the "What" level with expected completion time and expected outcome, to be 
updated with the actual completion time and outcome. At each level in the Why hierarchy, users can add "Reflections", serving as a journal of sorts.
